<h1>My page in simplepysite!</h1>
<p>This is a super-simple static site generator. It is basically just some convenience functions built on top of the markdown library (required). This package will provide you with a very simple template for writing blog-like posts, as well as some simple css. Standard markdown syntax applies, and this is true for images and links.</p>
<h2>Why do this?</h2>
<p>Many reasons!</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to make lists like this one.</li>
<li>I don't like static site generators</li>
<li>While I like Markdeep its kind of tricky</li>
<li>I want to learn css</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is some code I like!</p>
<pre><code>print(&quot;Hello&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Anything else?</h2>
<p>No</p>
<h3>Really?</h3>
<p>Correct</p>
<h4>OK.</h4>
<p>Goodbye</p>
