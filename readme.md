# Starbucks Promotions: Preference of customers to special offers

This repository has been used to analyze the behavior of starbucks customers in response to promotional offers. This has been assmebled in as part of the Udacity Data Science nanodegree program.

## Motivation

## Setup
If you want to recreate this analysis, you can follow the instructions below. This was executed on Windows 10 and edited in VS Code, but I see no reason why this won't run on other platforms. You WILL need python on your system.

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a virtual environment inside the repo:
```
python -m venv venv -- assuming you have python isntalled and in your path. 
```
3. Install requirements. Make sure to activate your virtual environment, then run the following:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
