# My page in simplepysite!

This is a super-simple static site generator. It is basically just some convenience functions built on top of the markdown library (required). This package will provide you with a very simple template for writing blog-like posts, as well as some simple css. Standard markdown syntax applies, and this is true for images and links.

## Why do this?

Many reasons!

1. I want to make lists like this one.
2. I don't like static site generators
3. While I like Markdeep its kind of tricky
4. I want to learn css

Here is some code I like!

```
print("Hello")
```

## Anything else?

No

### Really?

Correct

#### OK.

Goodbye
